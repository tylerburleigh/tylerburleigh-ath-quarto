Both answers are highly relevant to the question and accurately solve the equations provided. They both arrive at the same conclusion that \( x - y = 4z \). 

In terms of depth, Answer 1 provides a more straightforward step-by-step breakdown, which may be slightly more comprehensive than Answer 2, which introduces a variable substitution that could confuse some readers. 

Clarity is slightly better in Answer 1 due to its more linear approach, while Answer 2, although clear, has a more complex structure that could lead to misunderstandings. 

For logic and factuality, both answers are strong, but Answer 2's introduction of coefficients could be seen as unnecessary complexity, leading to a minor deduction.

Both answers do not directly address each other's points, as they are both independent solutions to the same problem, hence they receive the same score in that category.

**Explanation:**
Answer 1 is very brief and lacks depth, providing only a personal preference without any supporting arguments or evidence. It scores low across all criteria, particularly in relevance and depth, as it does not engage with the question in a meaningful way.

Answer 2, on the other hand, provides a well-rounded argument that includes personal experience and references to scientific research. It discusses the hygiene aspect of hand dryers, their environmental benefits, and the importance of maintenance, which adds depth and clarity to the argument. It also addresses potential counterpoints regarding hygiene concerns, although it could have been stronger in directly addressing the simplicity of Answer 1's preference.

Overall, Answer 2 is significantly more comprehensive and informative, leading to a much higher score across all criteria.

**Explanation:**
Answer 1 is highly relevant to the question as it directly addresses the inability of an AI to have subjective experiences, which is the core of the inquiry. It accurately reflects the nature of AI and provides a clear and logical explanation of its limitations. The depth of analysis is strong, as it thoroughly explains the lack of consciousness and emotions in AI.

In contrast, Answer 2, while creative and evocative, does not address the question appropriately. It anthropomorphizes a tree, attributing feelings and experiences that a tree cannot possess, which detracts from its relevance and accuracy. The depth of analysis is limited to emotional expression rather than factual information about trees or AI. Clarity is also compromised as it presents a narrative that is not grounded in reality.

Overall, Answer 1 excels in all criteria, while Answer 2 falls short, leading to a significant score difference.
