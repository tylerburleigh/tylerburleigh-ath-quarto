Thus, the Socratic method stands as the cornerstone of his challenge to conventional wisdom, making it the most significant method he employed."], ["While the Socratic method is indeed central to Socrates' philosophy, it is essential to recognize the complementary methods he employed. For instance, his use of irony often revealed contradictions in beliefs, while maieutics helped individuals uncover their innate knowledge.

This multifaceted strategy not only challenged prevailing thoughts but also enriched the dialogue, making his contributions far more profound than a singular focus on questioning.", "While our opponents rightly acknowledge the variety of Socratic methods, they fail to recognize that the essence of Socrates' approach lies in the Socratic method itself.
