A decrease in speed necessitates an increase in potential energy, leading to a higher altitude and larger orbital radius. This is not merely due to inertia but is fundamentally rooted in gravitational and centripetal forces. By emphasizing these principles, we provide a clearer and more scientifically robust explanation of why both the orbital radius and period of revolution increase.", "While our opponents emphasize energy conservation, we also highlight the fundamental relationship between speed, radius, and period in orbital dynamics. A decrease in speed directly leads to an increase in orbital radius due to the balance of gravitational and centripetal forces.
