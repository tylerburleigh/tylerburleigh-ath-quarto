This distinction is crucial for understanding quantum mechanics' implications, particularly in quantum technologies, where the interplay of entangled states offers profound advantages beyond simple state coexistence.", "Our argument clearly delineates superposition as the ability of a quantum system to exist in multiple states simultaneously, while entanglement describes the correlation between particles.
