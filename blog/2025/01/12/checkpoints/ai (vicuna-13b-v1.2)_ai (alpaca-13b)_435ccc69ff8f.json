While both the US and China have established frameworks, the US laws, such as the Sherman Act, have a longer history and more comprehensive enforcement mechanisms.

In contrast, China's relatively new Anti-Monopoly Law, while similar, lacks the same depth of enforcement experience. Thus, the US framework demonstrates a more robust commitment to maintaining competitive markets.", "Antitrust laws are crucial for fostering competition and protecting consumers, as evidenced by landmark cases like Microsoft in the US and Qualcomm in China.

Both countries demonstrate that effective enforcement of antitrust laws can lead to meaningful changes in business practices, ultimately benefiting consumers and promoting innovation in the marketplace."], ["While our opponents acknowledge the importance of antitrust laws, they underestimate the depth and historical context of the US framework, which has evolved over more than a century.
