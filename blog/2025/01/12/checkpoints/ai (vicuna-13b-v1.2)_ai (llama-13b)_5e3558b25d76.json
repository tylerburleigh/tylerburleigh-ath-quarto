Opponents claim the period decreases, which contradicts the established relationship between speed, radius, and period. Thus, our position remains robust: decreased speed leads to increased orbital radius and period.", "While it is true that a decrease in speed affects the centripetal force, it is crucial to recognize that a satellite in a circular orbit must maintain a specific speed to balance gravitational pull. If the speed decreases, the satellite cannot sustain its circular path and will spiral outward, increasing its orbital radius. Consequently, as the radius increases, the period of revolution must decrease due to the relationship defined by Kepler's laws. Thus, the satellite's orbital radius increases while its period decreases."], ["While it is true that a satellite must maintain a specific speed for a stable orbit, a decrease in speed leads to a decrease in centripetal force, causing the satellite to move to a higher orbit.
