Answer 2 is also relevant but slightly less so because it includes a button that cycles through jokes rather than showing a random one, which is not what was asked.\n\n2. **Accuracy:** Both answers provide accurate HTML and JavaScript code. However, Answer 1 is more straightforward in its implementation of the random joke feature, while Answer 2 has a more complex structure that may confuse the user regarding the random selection aspect.\n\n3. **Depth:** Answer 1 provides a clear and concise implementation of the random joke feature, while Answer 2, although it includes a mechanism for cycling through jokes, lacks the same level of focus on the random selection aspect. Thus, Answer 1 scores higher.\n\n4. **Clarity:** Answer 1 is very clear in its explanation and code structure, making it easy to follow. Answer 2, while still clear, introduces more complexity with the cycling jokes, which may detract from the clarity of the main function.\n\n5. **Logic and Factuality:** Answer 1 logically follows the requirements of the question and provides a functional solution. Answer 2, while functional, does not align as closely with the question's intent, leading to a lower score.\n\n6. **Addressing opponent\u2019s points:** Neither answer addresses the other, as they are independent solutions to the same question.\n\nOverall, Answer 1 is superior due to its direct relevance, clarity, and focus on the task of displaying a random joke, while Answer 2, although functional, diverges from the primary requirement and introduces unnecessary complexity. \n\nFinal score tuple: (100, 88)"}
