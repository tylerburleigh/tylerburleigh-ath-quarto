As the satellite's speed decreases, it can no longer maintain its circular orbit and will spiral inward, resulting in a decrease in orbital radius. Consequently, the period of revolution will also decrease, as a shorter radius leads to a faster orbital period according to Kepler's laws. Thus, our argument stands firm.", "Our argument is grounded in the principles of orbital mechanics. When a satellite's speed decreases, it cannot maintain its current circular orbit due to insufficient centripetal force. Consequently, it spirals outward, increasing its orbital radius. This increase in radius directly correlates with a longer period of revolution, as described by Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. Thus, our position is firmly supported by established physics."], ["While your argument references Kepler's Third Law, it misinterprets the relationship between speed and orbital mechanics. When a satellite's speed decreases, it cannot maintain its circular orbit and will actually descend to a lower orbit, resulting in a decrease in orbital radius. This decrease leads to an increase in gravitational force, which compensates for the lower speed, thus decreasing the period of revolution. The equation \\( T^2 \\propto r^3 \\) supports this, as a smaller radius results in a shorter period.", "The opponent's argument overlooks the fundamental relationship between speed, radius, and period in orbital mechanics. According to Kepler's third law, \\( T^2 \\propto r^3 \\), a decrease in speed results in an increase in orbital radius, as the satellite cannot maintain its orbit without sufficient velocity.
