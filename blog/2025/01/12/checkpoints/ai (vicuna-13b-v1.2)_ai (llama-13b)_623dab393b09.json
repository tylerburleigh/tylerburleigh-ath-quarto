Answer 2, however, does not provide any relevant information or data, merely stating that it will present the prices without any context or details. Thus, Answer 1 scores a perfect 20, while Answer 2 scores a mere 5.\n  \n- **Accuracy**: Answer 1 presents a code that, while it has some logical flaws, is fundamentally aimed at achieving the task of extracting prices. Answer 2 does not provide any actual data or analysis, leading to a low score of 5. Answer 1 receives an 18 for its attempt at accuracy.\n\n- **Depth**: Answer 1 provides a comprehensive solution with a detailed code that covers various aspects of the task, including reading data, processing it, and writing to a CSV. Answer 2 lacks depth entirely, offering no analysis or data, resulting in a score of 5.\n\n- **Clarity**: Answer 1 is mostly clear in its expression, although the code could be better structured. Answer 2 is vague and does not clarify what it intends to present, leading to a low score of 5.\n\n- **Logic and Factuality**: Answer 1 demonstrates logical flow in its approach to solving the problem, while Answer 2 does not present any factual information or logical reasoning, resulting in a score of 5.\n\n- **Addressing opponent\u2019s points**: Since Answer 2 does not provide any substantial content, it does not address any points made by Answer 1. Answer 1, while not directly addressing an opponent, still provides a more robust argument, earning a score of 15.\n\nOverall, Answer 1 is significantly better than Answer 2 across all criteria, leading to a final score of (109, 30)."}
