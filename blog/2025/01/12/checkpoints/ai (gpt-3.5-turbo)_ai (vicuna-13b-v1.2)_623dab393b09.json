However, Answer 1 is slightly more focused on the task at hand, while Answer 2 introduces unnecessary complexity with additional data points that are not requested, leading to a slightly lower score.\n\n2. **Accuracy**: Both answers provide accurate code for extracting the required data. However, Answer 1 is more straightforward and avoids potential pitfalls in data handling, while Answer 2 has some inaccuracies in how it processes the data (e.g., it does not correctly handle the closing prices). Thus, Answer 1 scores higher.\n\n3. **Depth**: Answer 1 provides a clear and concise solution, while Answer 2 attempts to include more details (like volume and differences), which could be seen as unnecessary for the question asked. However, the additional complexity in Answer 2 leads to a lower score for depth due to potential confusion.\n\n4. **Clarity**: Answer 1 is very clear and logically structured, making it easy to follow. Answer 2, while informative, is less clear due to its complexity and the introduction of multiple variables that may confuse the reader.\n\n5. **Logic and Factuality**: Answer 1 maintains a logical flow and factual accuracy throughout. Answer 2, while attempting to provide more information, introduces some inaccuracies and logical inconsistencies, particularly in how it handles the data extraction and storage.\n\n6. **Addressing opponent\u2019s points**: This criterion is less applicable as there are no direct opposing points in the answers. However, Answer 1's straightforward approach effectively addresses the question without unnecessary complications, while Answer 2's complexity could be seen as a weakness.\n\nOverall, Answer 1 is superior due to its relevance, accuracy, clarity, and logical flow, while Answer 2, despite its attempt to provide more information, ultimately complicates the task and introduces inaccuracies. \n\nFinal score tuple: (118, 99)"}
