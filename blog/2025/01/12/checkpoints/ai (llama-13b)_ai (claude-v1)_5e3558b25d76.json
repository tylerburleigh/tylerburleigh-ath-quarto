This aligns with the principles of orbital mechanics, contradicting the opponent's claims.", "Our argument is grounded in the fundamental principles of physics, specifically the conservation of angular momentum. When the satellite's speed decreases, it must decrease its orbital radius to maintain constant angular momentum. This directly contradicts our opponents' claim of an increasing radius. Furthermore, the relationship between radius and period indicates that a decrease in radius, coupled with a decrease in speed, results in an increased period. Thus, our reasoning is consistent and supported by established physics principles."], ["While angular momentum conservation is crucial, it must be considered alongside gravitational dynamics. As the satellite's speed decreases, it cannot maintain a stable orbit at a lower radius due to insufficient centripetal force. Instead, the satellite will move to a higher orbit, increasing its radius. According to Kepler's laws, a larger radius correlates with a longer period of revolution. Thus, both the orbital radius increases and the period decreases, aligning with the principles of orbital mechanics.", "While it's true that angular momentum is conserved, a decrease in the satellite's speed results in a decrease in centripetal force, which cannot sustain a higher orbit.
