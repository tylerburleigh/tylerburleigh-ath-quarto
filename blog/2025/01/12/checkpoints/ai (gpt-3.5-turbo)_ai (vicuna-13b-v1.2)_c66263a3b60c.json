Answer 2, while relevant, is less comprehensive and focuses more on ratings without elaborating on the features. Thus, Answer 1 scores higher.\n\n2. **Accuracy**: Both answers provide accurate ratings, but Answer 1 offers more detailed insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each phone, which enhances its credibility. Answer 2's ratings are slightly less substantiated, leading to a lower score.\n\n3. **Depth**: Answer 1 presents a thorough analysis of each phone, discussing various aspects such as design, performance, and features. Answer 2 lacks this depth, providing only overall ratings without the supporting details, resulting in a lower score.\n\n4. **Clarity**: Both answers are clear, but Answer 1's structured breakdown of each phone's attributes makes it easier to follow. Answer 2 is also clear but less informative, leading to a slightly lower score.\n\n5. **Logic and Factuality**: Answer 1 logically supports its ratings with specific reasons for each phone's score, while Answer 2 does not provide the same level of factual support for its ratings.
