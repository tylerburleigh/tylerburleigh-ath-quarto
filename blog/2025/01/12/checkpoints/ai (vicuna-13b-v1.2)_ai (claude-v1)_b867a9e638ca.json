It is accurate, citing the location and historical context correctly. The depth of analysis is strong, as it elaborates on the White House's history and architecture, although it could have included more about its role in American politics. Clarity is excellent, with a logical flow that makes the information easy to understand. The reasoning is solid, supported by factual information.\n\nAnswer 2, on the other hand, lacks relevance as it does not address the question about the White House at all. Its accuracy is limited since it does not provide any information about the White House, and it fails to engage with the question's content. The depth of analysis is minimal, and while it is clear in its expression, it does not provide any substantial information. The logic and factuality are weak due to the lack of relevant content. It also does not address any points made in the first answer, which further diminishes its effectiveness.\n\nOverall, Answer 1 is significantly stronger across all criteria, leading to a much higher score compared to Answer 2. \n\nFinal score tuple: (113, 53)"}
