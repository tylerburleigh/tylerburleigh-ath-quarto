Unlike suspension bridges, cable-stayed designs require fewer materials and can be constructed more quickly, making them ideal for the 1.8 km span. Additionally, their simpler construction allows for easier maintenance and inspections, ensuring long-term resilience. By prioritizing both seismic safety and economic efficiency, a cable-stayed bridge is the optimal solution for the Vegona River.", "While cable-stayed bridges offer flexibility, our comprehensive approach addresses all critical aspects of seismic resilience. We emphasize not only the bridge type but also the importance of stable foundations, seismic isolation bearings, and the use of ductile materials. Our design incorporates redundancy and regular monitoring, ensuring long-term safety and performance. By considering all these factors, we can guarantee that the Vegona River bridge will withstand major earthquakes with minimal damage, surpassing the benefits of a cable-stayed design alone."], ["While your comprehensive approach is commendable, the cable-stayed bridge's inherent design features, such as its efficient load distribution and reduced material usage, enhance seismic resilience. Successful examples, like the Tsing Ma Bridge, demonstrate their performance in earthquakes.
